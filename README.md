Hi, I'm Adarsh. **I'm a brand identity designer, web designer, and front-end developer** with over 6+ months of experience.
You can also call me a **product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX**, or any other market-defined function title.
Chess, Rubik's Cube, and trying to understand my Pet Dog's cheesy behavior are my hobbies.

I'm not particularly eager to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught; personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do exciting things that matter.

Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I'm a passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead, I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.

My abundant energy fuels me to pursue many interests, hobbies, areas of study, and artistic endeavors. I'm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. 



I'm currently a Student of HPT Arts and RYK Science College, doing HSC from Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as my main subjects, and CS as an optional one.
I know the basics of C++ and HTML5, CSS3 and I'm currently learning them. 
Aiming to be a Good Developer in both, Frontend and Backend, Full Stack Developer that is.

Currently, I'm a Graphic and Logo Designer and a Web Designer and Developer.
I'm freelancing on Fiverr and Upwork.

I'm ready for any kind of work, even if it's unpaid, it should just fit with my schedule and should be good for me.

I play with my pet dog Bolt, try to speed solve Rubik's Cube, and Play Chess in my free time.
