# Hey there 👋, I'm Adarsh Dubey

Building ML infrastructure and full-stack applications. Recently wrapped up GSoC 2025 with Google DeepMind.

## 🚀 What I Do

I work at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering — building tools that make ML more accessible and creating robust full-stack applications. Currently focused on fine-tuning infrastructure, deep learning from scratch, and scalable web platforms.

## 🔨 Recent Work

**[Gemma Facet](https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/gemma-facet)** — No-code platform for fine-tuning Google DeepMind's Gemma models  
Built during GSoC 2025. Handles dataset preprocessing, model training, and exports to multiple formats (GGUF, quantized, etc.). Full pipeline from data upload to deployment-ready models.

**[IncliArray](https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/incliarray)** — N-dimensional array library with autograd in C++  
Minimal implementation with reverse-mode automatic differentiation, broadcasting, and stride-aware memory management. Think NumPy meets autograd, but in C++.

**[Inclinet](https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/inclinet)** — Deep learning library from scratch  
Pure Python/NumPy implementation of neural networks. Layers, optimizers, loss functions — all built from first principles.

**Anon Forum** — Anonymous social platform for my college  
Full-stack app with Google OAuth verification but zero personal data storage. FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, deployed on AWS.

## 💼 Experience

**Open Source Developer @ Google DeepMind** (GSoC 2025)  
Built core microservices for dataset preprocessing and model export pipelines. Worked on the Gemma Facet project, creating tools used by the ML community for fine-tuning multimodal models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**ML/AI:** PyTorch, Keras, Hugging Face, Unsloth  
**Web:** Next.js, React, FastAPI, Node.js  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**Cloud & Tools:** Docker, GCP, AWS, Git
